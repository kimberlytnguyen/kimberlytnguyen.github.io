									<h3><span class="uline">A</span>bout Me</h3>
										<p class="description" style="font-size:0.9em;">
											It all started when my brother taught me how to Photoshop my 9-year-old face onto the body of an orangutan.
											<br><br>
											All my life, I've been drawn to making cool stuff digitally. Photoshop was my first love as an early teen. I taught myself the ins and outs of Photoshop, all while learning to create images of my dog riding rainbows in space. Soon after, I got my first DSLR camera and discovered my natural eye for composition, which proved to be useful later when I became a photographer for Humans of UCLA and generated top-performing content. In high school, I was all about video creation and was a leading creator in my broadcast journalism class. I tried to make it big on YouTube - all while using my family's tape camcorder. In college, my entrepreneurial spirit led me to graphic design and I ran a successful side hustle as a top-rated seller creating flyers for small businesses. After college, I taught myself basic HTML/CSS and learned to make this website.
											<br><br>
											When I'm not gleefully tapping away behind my laptop, you can find me tending to my plant children, learning dance choreography at my favorite studio, or whipping up a tasty dish in the kitchen.
